# Flappy Bird Game

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Java Swing. The game features a controllable bird that can be maneuvered through openings between pipes. Points are earned for successfully navigating through the pipes, and the game ends if the bird collides with the pipes or goes out of bounds.

## Features
- **Bird Control:** Control the bird's upward movement using the "UP" key or by clicking the mouse.
- **Dynamic Pipes:** Pipes move from right to left, creating openings for the bird to pass through.
- **Scoring System:** Accumulate points for successfully navigating through the openings between pipes.
- **Game Over:** The game concludes if the bird collides with pipes or goes out of bounds. A prompt asks if the player wants to retry.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Control the bird's flight by pressing the "UP" key or clicking the mouse.
3. Navigate the bird through the openings between pipes.
4. Earn points for successful passes.
5. If the bird collides with pipes or goes out of bounds, a prompt will appear to inquire whether you want to retry.

## Controls
- **UP Key:** Control the bird's upward movement.
- **Mouse Click:** Control the bird's upward movement.

## Development Environment
- **Language:** Java
- **GUI Library:** Swing

## Game Logic
- The bird's position and velocity are updated based on user input (key press or mouse click).
- Pipes move from right to left, creating a dynamic environment.
- Score is calculated based on successful passes through pipe openings.
- The game concludes if the bird collides with pipes or goes out of bounds.
- Players can choose to retry or exit the game after a game over.

## How to Build and Run
1. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
   ```bash
   javac Main.java

2. Run the compiled program.
  ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## Dependencies
- Java Standard Library
